# Assignment 1 Essay

## Your motivation for learning high-performance computing
I want to learn high performance computing because I think it is super useful for data analytics. Not only does it enable us to be able to work with huge datasets, but it also makes complex calculations more time efficient. I have an internship currently where I am working with large datasets of EMS/Fire calls, so I thought practice working with big datasets could be useful for my life post-grad.

## Your goals for the course
The only goal I have for this course is to grow my knowledge(even a little bit!) of supercomputing, which will definitely happen since my current experience is close to none.

## Your plan of attack for learning this semester
My plan of attack for learning this semester is to make sure I am following along at every step of the way rather than trying to cram in lots of information at once. I do better reviewing concepts right as we learn them (such as after class) rather than trying to catch up over the weekend on things from the week prior. I think practice also makes perfect when it comes to coding so I will try to use the examples you post to prepare for assignments/quizzes. 

## Why the folder structure you created is good for reproducible research
The folder structure I created is good for reproducible research because it ensures that someone who views my work (or even myself coming back to my work!) understands every step I took to get my results. It organizes the different steps (such as having places to store raw data, cleaned data, scripts, etc.), enabling anyone to rerun the project from start to finish. I am glad that in the assignment it was suggested that we make a separate folder for raw and clean data. As simple as this is, it is something that my teachers haven’t done in past classes I have taken so I have not picked up the habit yet. 

## Your understanding of why we use documented code to do computational research tasks
I think we use documented code to do computational research tasks because reproducibility is so important for scientific research. I know we have talked about this in class, but I think it is always important to emphasize documentation so that code can be reused and still work, rather than only running when you use it for your research. It also can help reduce errors because every step is carefully explained and reviewed. This also helps when coming back to your code after long periods of time, because likely you may have forgotten why you ran a line of code. Along with preventing errors, it also helps peer review of your work.  

## Anything else you want me to know about you, your background, or what/why you hope to learn 

I am currently a senior studying data science so I’m really hoping this class can help prepare me for the workforce post graduation or at least add a new skill to my resume. I also am currently working a GIS internship remotely this semester so a decent amount of my time is spent doing that (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). I am used to working with spatial data due to my spatial data analytics concentration, so I am excited to get a little out of my comfort zone this semester.
